# YourCookBook
Created for the final project of CSC 690 - Interactive Multimedia Application Development

This app seeks to allow users to create their own cookbook by adding recipes. Additionally, users should be able to explore previously created recipes.

This app uses both Realm and Realmswift added through XCode's package library using the Package URL: github.com/realm/realm-cocoa.git

Sources that helped: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R9DJxjmSCk which helped how to show how to format data into lists and how to write using Realm.
